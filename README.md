# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to see if there was any bias in the Amazon Vine program which is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products.

## Analysis

We first sorted through which reviews were helpful and which were not based on the percentage of helpfule votes. We then chose only those that had a 50% or greater helpful rating. Of these there were 613 vine program reviews and 64968 non-vine program reviews. There were 200 (32.62%) five star vine program reviews and 28842 (44.39%) five star non-vine program reviews. 

## Summary

In summary there was no bias in the paid reviews, and in fact there might be a negative bias. This could be because paid reviewers want to make there reviews more believable and therefore give a more realistic review. Further analysis should be down on the percentage of other stars for paid vs non-paid reviews.
